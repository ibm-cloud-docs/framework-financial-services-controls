# IR-4 - Incident Handling
{: #ir-4}

## Requirements
{: #requirements}

The organization:

- \[a.\] Implements an incident handling capability for security incidents that includes preparation, detection and analysis, containment, eradication, and recovery;

- \[b.\] Coordinates incident handling activities with contingency planning activities; and

- \[c.\] Incorporates lessons learned from ongoing incident handling activities into incident response procedures, training, and testing, and implements the resulting changes accordingly.

## Control Additional FS Cloud Specifications
{: #additional-fs-cloud-specifications}

The organization must develop, document, and implement a forensics evidence process for the gathering, protection, preservation, and retention (including controlled access and evidence chain) of forensic evidence and investigation activities in accordance with customer requirements.

## Control Supplemental Guidance
{: #supplemental_guidance}

Organizations recognize that incident response capability is dependent on the capabilities of organizational information systems and the mission/business processes being supported by those systems. Therefore, organizations consider incident response as part of the definition, design, and development of mission/business processes and information systems. Incident-related information can be obtained from a variety of sources including, for example, audit monitoring, network monitoring, physical access monitoring, user/administrator reports, and reported supply chain events. Effective incident handling capability includes coordination among many organizational entities including, for example, mission/business owners, information system owners, authorizing officials, human resources offices, physical and personnel security offices, legal departments, operations personnel, procurement offices, and the risk executive (function).
