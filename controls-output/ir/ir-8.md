  - \[4.\] Meets the unique requirements of the organization, which relate to mission, size, structure, and functions;
  - \[5.\] Defines reportable incidents;
  - \[6.\] Provides metrics for measuring the incident response capability within the organization;
  - \[7.\] Defines the resources and management support needed to effectively maintain and mature an incident response capability; and
  - \[8.\] Is reviewed and approved by [organization-defined personnel or roles];

- \[b.\] Distributes copies of the incident response plan to [organization-defined incident response personnel (identified by name and/or by role) and organizational elements];

It is important that organizations develop and implement a coordinated approach to incident response. Organizational missions, business functions, strategies, goals, and objectives for incident response help to determine the structure of incident response capabilities. As part of a comprehensive incident response capability, organizations consider the coordination and sharing of information with external organizations, including, for example, external service providers and organizations involved in the supply chain for organizational information systems.
