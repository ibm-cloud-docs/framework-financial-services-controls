# IR-3 - Incident Response Testing
{: #ir-3}

## Requirements
{: #requirements}

The organization tests the incident response capability for the information system [at least annually] using [organization-defined tests] to determine the incident response effectiveness and documents the results.

## Control Additional FS Cloud Specifications
{: #additional-fs-cloud-specifications}

If lessons learned result in any necessary improvements to existing processes, ensure they are incorporated into the contingency plan no later than 30 days following all contingency events and exercises.

## Control Supplemental Guidance
{: #supplemental-guidance}

Organizations test incident response capabilities to determine the overall effectiveness of the capabilities and to identify potential weaknesses or deficiencies. Incident response testing includes, for example, the use of checklists, walk-through or tabletop exercises, simulations (parallel/full interrupt), and comprehensive exercises. Incident response testing can also include a determination of the effects on organizational operations (e.g., reduction in mission capabilities), organizational assets, and individuals due to incident response.
