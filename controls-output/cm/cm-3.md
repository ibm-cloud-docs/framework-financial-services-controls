{: #requirements}

The organization:

(a) Determines the types of changes to the information system that are configuration-controlled;

(b) Reviews proposed configuration-controlled changes to the information system and approves or disapproves such changes with explicit consideration for security impact analyses;

(c) Documents configuration change decisions associated with the information system;

(d) Implements approved configuration-controlled changes to the information system;

(e) Retains records of configuration-controlled changes to the information system for [in accordance with record retention policies and procedures];

(f) Audits and reviews activities associated with configuration-controlled changes to the information system; and

## NIST supplemental guidance
{: #supplemental-guidance}

Configuration change controls for organizational information systems involve the systematic proposal, justification, implementation, testing, review, and disposition of changes to the systems, including system upgrades and modifications. Configuration change control includes changes to baseline configurations for components and configuration items of information systems, changes to configuration settings for information technology products (e.g., operating systems, applications, firewalls, routers, and mobile devices), unscheduled/unauthorized changes, and changes to remediate vulnerabilities. Typical processes for managing configuration changes to information systems include, for example, Configuration Control Boards that approve proposed changes to systems. For new development information systems or systems undergoing major upgrades, organizations consider including representatives from development organizations on the Configuration Control Boards. Auditing of changes includes activities before and after changes are made to organizational information systems and the auditing activities required to implement such changes.
