# CM-7 (1) - Periodic Review
{: #cm-7.1}

## Requirements
{: #requirements}

The organization:

- \[(a)\] Reviews the information system [at least monthly] to identify unnecessary and/or nonsecure functions, ports, protocols, and services; and

- \[(b)\] Disables [organization-defined functions, ports, protocols, and services within the information system deemed to be unnecessary and/or nonsecure].

## Control Supplemental Guidance
{: #supplemental-guidance}

The organization can either make a determination of the relative security of the function, port, protocol, and/or service or base the security decision on the assessment of other entities. Bluetooth, FTP, and peer-to-peer networking are examples of less than secure protocols.
