# CM-7 (1) - Periodic Review
{: #cm-7.1}

## Control requirements
{: #control-requirements}

The organization:

CM-7 (1) (a)
    : Reviews the information system _[at least monthly]_ to identify unnecessary and/or nonsecure functions, ports, protocols, and services; and

CM-7 (1) (b)
    : Disables _[organization-defined functions, ports, protocols, and services within the information system deemed to be unnecessary and/or nonsecure]_.

## NIST supplemental guidance
{: #nist-supplemental-guidance}

The organization can either make a determination of the relative security of the function, port, protocol, and/or service or base the security decision on the assessment of other entities. Bluetooth, FTP, and peer-to-peer networking are examples of less than secure protocols.
