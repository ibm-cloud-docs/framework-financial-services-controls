# CM-8 (4) - Accountability Information
{: #cm-8.4}

## Requirements
{: #requirements}

The organization includes in the information system component inventory information, a means for identifying by _[asset owner/custodian]_, individuals responsible/accountable for administering those components.

## NIST supplemental guidance
{: #supplemental-guidance}

Identifying individuals who are both responsible and accountable for administering information system components helps to ensure that the assigned components are properly administered and organizations can contact those individuals if some action is required (e.g., component is determined to be the source of a breach/compromise, component needs to be recalled/replaced, or component needs to be relocated).
