### CM-2 (2) - 0


Maintain the currency, completeness, accuracy, and availability of the baseline configuration of the system using _[Assignment: organization-defined automated mechanisms]_.












## NIST supplemental guidance
{: #nist-supplemental-guidance}

Automated mechanisms that help organizations maintain consistent baseline configurations for systems include configuration management tools, hardware, software, firmware inventory tools, and network management tools. Automated tools can be used at the organization level, mission and business process level, or system level on workstations, servers, notebook computers, network components, or mobile devices. Tools can be used to track version numbers on operating systems, applications, types of software installed, and current patch levels. Automation support for accuracy and currency can be satisfied by the implementation of CM-8(2) for organizations that combine system component inventory and baseline configuration activities.
