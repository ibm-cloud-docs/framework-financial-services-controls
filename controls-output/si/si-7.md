# SI-7 - Software, Firmware, And Information Integrity
{: #si-7}

## Requirements
{: #requirements}

The organization employs integrity verification tools to detect unauthorized changes to _[organization-defined software, firmware, and information]_.

## Implementation guidance
{: #implementation-guidance}

See the resources that follow to learn more about how to implement this control.

## NIST supplemental guidance
{: #supplemental-guidance}

Unauthorized changes to software, firmware, and information can occur due to errors or malicious activity (e.g., tampering). Software includes, for example, operating systems (with key internal components such as kernels, drivers), middleware, and applications. Firmware includes, for example, the Basic Input Output System (BIOS). Information includes metadata such as security attributes associated with information. State-of-the-practice integrity-checking mechanisms (e.g., parity checks, cyclical redundancy checks, cryptographic hashes) and associated tools can automatically monitor the integrity of information systems and hosted applications.
