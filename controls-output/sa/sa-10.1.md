## IBM Cloud for Financial Services profile
{: #scc-fs-cloud-profile}

The goals that follow are part of the IBM Cloud for Financial Services v0.6.0 profile in [{{site.data.keyword.compliance_full}}](/docs/security-compliance?topic=security-compliance-getting-started).

- 3000601: Check whether Container Registry Vulnerability Advisor scans for critical or high vulnerabilities in the system at least every # day(s) 
- 3000611: Check whether Container Registry Vulnerability Advisor scans images for OS vulnerability detection

## NIST supplemental guidance
{: #nist-supplemental-guidance}

This control enhancement allows organizations to detect unauthorized changes to software and firmware components through the use of tools, techniques, and/or mechanisms provided by developers. Integrity checking mechanisms can also address counterfeiting of software and firmware components. Organizations verify the integrity of software and firmware components, for example, through secure one-way hashes provided by developers. Delivered software and firmware components also include any updates to such components.
