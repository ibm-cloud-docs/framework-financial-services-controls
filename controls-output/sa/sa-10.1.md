# SA-10 (1) -  Software and Firmware Integrity Verification
{: #sa-10.1}

## Control requirements

### SA-10 (1) - 0


Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to enable integrity verification of software and firmware components.












## NIST supplemental guidance
{: #nist-supplemental-guidance}

Software and firmware integrity verification allows organizations to detect unauthorized changes to software and firmware components using developer-provided tools, techniques, and mechanisms. The integrity checking mechanisms can also address counterfeiting of software and firmware components. Organizations verify the integrity of software and firmware components, for example, through secure one-way hashes provided by developers. Delivered software and firmware components also include any updates to such components.
