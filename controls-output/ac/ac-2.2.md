# AC-2 (2) - Removal Of Temporary / Emergency Accounts
{: #ac-2.2}

## Requirements
{: #requirements}

The information system automatically [removes; disables] temporary and emergency accounts after [no more than 30 days for temporary and emergency account types].

## NIST supplemental guidance
{: #supplemental-guidance}

This control enhancement requires the removal of both temporary and emergency accounts automatically after a predefined period of time has elapsed, rather than at the convenience of the systems administrator.
