# AC-2 (2) - Removal of Temporary / Emergency Accounts
{: #ac-2.2}

## Control requirements
{: #control-requirements}

AC-2 (2) - 0
    : The information system automatically [[Selection (): removes; disables]] temporary and emergency accounts after [[Assignment: organization-defined time period for each type of account]].

## NIST supplemental guidance
{: #nist-supplemental-guidance}

This control enhancement requires the removal of both temporary and emergency accounts automatically after a predefined period of time has elapsed, rather than at the convenience of the systems administrator.
