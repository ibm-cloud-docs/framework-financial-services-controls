# AC-2 (2) - Removal Of Temporary / Emergency Accounts
{: #ac-2.2}

## Control requirements
{: #control-requirements}

The information system automatically _[removes; disables]_ temporary and emergency accounts after _[no more than 30 days for temporary and emergency account types]_.

## NIST supplemental guidance
{: #nist-supplemental-guidance}

This control enhancement requires the removal of both temporary and emergency accounts automatically after a predefined period of time has elapsed, rather than at the convenience of the systems administrator.
