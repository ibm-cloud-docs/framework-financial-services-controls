- \[k.\] Establishes a process for reissuing shared/group account credentials (if deployed) when individuals are removed from the group.

## Additional IBM Cloud for Financial Services specifications
{: #additional-fs-cloud-specifications}

Prior to production access, users must be onboarded and registered in the customer&#39;s access management system.  

The organization must be able to export all current customer end users and permissions within the organizationâ€™s application/system.

Access activity/logs should be reported to the customer daily, as required.

Access activity/logs should contain the following content: user ID, associated roles and permissions, business/job function, last logon date.

Account managers must include the individual&#39;s or system&#39;s manager and account owner.

## NIST supplemental guidance
{: #supplemental-guidance}

Information system account types include, for example, individual, shared, group, system, guest/anonymous, emergency, developer/manufacturer/vendor, temporary, and service. Some of the account management requirements listed above can be implemented by organizational information systems. The identification of authorized users of the information system and the specification of access privileges reflects the requirements in other security controls in the security plan. Users requiring administrative privileges on information system accounts receive additional scrutiny by appropriate organizational personnel (e.g., system owner, mission/business owner, or chief information security officer) responsible for approving such accounts and privileged access. Organizations may choose to define access privileges or other attributes by account, by type of account, or a combination of both. Other attributes required for authorizing access include, for example, restrictions on time-of-day, day-of-week, and point-of-origin. In defining other account attributes, organizations consider system-related requirements (e.g., scheduled maintenance, system upgrades) and mission/business requirements, (e.g., time zone differences, customer requirements, remote access to support travel requirements). Failure to consider these factors could affect information system availability. Temporary and emergency accounts are accounts intended for short-term use. Organizations establish temporary accounts as a part of normal account activation procedures when there is a need for short-term accounts without the demand for immediacy in account activation. Organizations establish emergency accounts in response to crisis situations and with the need for rapid account activation. Therefore, emergency account activation may bypass normal account authorization processes. Emergency and temporary accounts are not to be confused with infrequently used accounts (e.g., local logon accounts used for special tasks defined by organizations or when network resources are unavailable). Such accounts remain available and are not subject to automatic disabling or removal dates. Conditions for disabling or deactivating accounts include, for example: (i) when shared/group, emergency, or temporary accounts are no longer required; or (ii) when individuals are transferred or terminated. Some types of information system accounts may require specialized training.



## Part a. (from CIO template and not for production)
{: #part-a}

### Implementation guidance (from CIO template and not for production)
{: #part-a-implementation-guidance}

Identify types of accounts to support organizational missions/business functions.  When specifying account types, the provider considers the following account types that apply for their IBM Cloud accounts, host operating systems, and applications: individual, shared, group, system, guest/anonymous, emergency, developer/manufacturer/vendor, temporary, service accounts, privileged administrator accounts, domain administrator accounts, local device accounts, and customer privileged administrative accounts.
An IBM Cloud account is required to create and manage IBM Cloud resources. Within an account, the account owner or their delegate can create an access group to organize a set of users and service IDs into a single entity and easily assign permissions. Accesses can be grouped into policies and applied to groups of users instead of assigning the same access multiple times per individual user or service ID.
Those individuals who are responsible for the development and operation of the production environment where provider is hosting the application should be assigned to an access group that is separate from the users who can order and configure services from the IBM Cloud console, command line interface (CLI), or application programming interface (PI) (e.g., the admin that is responsible for the configuration of encryption should not have the ability to write data within the environment because they could turn off encryption, write data, or turn on encryption (and thereby bypass encrypting data at rest and/or  the administrator that is responsible for setting audit levels should not be able to perform actions within the application such as  turning on/off audit or dump data.   provider should have RBAC configured for all its staff enforcing separation of duties (SOD).
For additional information on IBM Cloud accounts, please refer to Overview of accounts, identity management, and access control.
The following provides additional context for the domains mentioned above:

Provider operators:

- IBM Cloud account users: Includes administrators whose function is to order resources to be used in the providers deployment such as
virtual private clouds (VPC), virtual servers, etc. and operators who need to access cloud resources for operations. IBM Cloud IAM can
federate to the providers identity provider (IdP).
- Operating System (OS) operator/application account users: This is the domain that defines provider users with fewer privileges than administrators described above. These users may be operators who only need access to the OS level of the virtual machines (VM)/containers, application developers, testers, and other less-privileged roles relative to the operation of the IBM Cloud deployment itself.
- Consumer users: This domain is where the consumer end users are defined. provider may assist the consumer with integration of the consumer&#39;s IdP.  Doing this enables application users to consume the consumer service using single sign-on.

Provider is also responsible for identifying account types for their internal operators within the application, as well as providing the capability for the consumer to implement RBAC within the application.
The consumer is responsible for managing their own external end user accounts for the consumer application.
Service Accounts and credentials (e.g., Service IDs, system to system application credentials, certificates, tokens, etc.):  provider shall maintain service accounts and ensure rotation of such accounts minimally on an annual basis.  Such credentials are usually maintained in a vault.

Note: Guidance on Service IDs is available.

Application Programming Interfaces (API): provider is to create identifiers/API Keys to be used by provider APIs, when applicable, that interact with components within the consumer application and audit their use.  Provider APIs may also be called by consumers, and their use should be logged.

### Evidence guidance (from CIO template and not for production)
