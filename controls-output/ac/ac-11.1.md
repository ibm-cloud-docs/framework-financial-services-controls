# AC-11 (1) - Pattern-Hiding Displays
{: #ac-11.1}

## Requirements
{: #requirements}

The information system conceals, via the session lock, information previously visible on the display with a publicly viewable image.

## Control Supplemental Guidance
{: #supplemental-guidance}

Publicly viewable images can include static or dynamic images, for example, patterns used with screen savers, photographic images, solid colors, clock, battery life indicator, or a blank screen, with the additional caveat that none of the images convey sensitive information.
