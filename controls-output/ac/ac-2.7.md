The organization:

- ((a)\] Establishes and administers privileged user accounts in accordance with a role-based access scheme that organizes allowed information system access and privileges into roles;
- ((b)\] Monitors privileged role assignments; and
- ((c)\] Takes _[organization-defined actions]_ when privileged role assignments are no longer appropriate.

{: #supplemental-guidance}

Privileged roles are organization-defined roles assigned to individuals that allow those individuals to perform certain security-relevant functions that ordinary users are not authorized to perform. These privileged roles include, for example, key management, account management, network and system administration, database administration, and web administration.
