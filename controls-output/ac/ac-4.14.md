# AC-4 (14) - Security Policy Filter Constraints
{: #ac-4.14}

## Requirements
{: #requirements}

The information system, when transferring information between different security domains, implements [organization-defined security policy filters] requiring fully enumerated formats that restrict data structure and content.

## NIST supplemental guidance
{: #supplemental-guidance}

Data structure and content restrictions reduce the range of potential malicious and/or unsanctioned content in cross-domain transactions. Security policy filters that restrict data structures include, for example, restricting file sizes and field lengths. Data content policy filters include, for example: (i) encoding formats for character sets (e.g., Universal Character Set Transformation Formats, American Standard Code for Information Interchange); (ii) restricting character data fields to only contain alpha-numeric characters; (iii) prohibiting special characters; and (iv) validating schema structures.
