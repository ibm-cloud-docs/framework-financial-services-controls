{: #ac-5}

## Requirements
{: #requirements}

The organization:

- \[a.\] Separates [organization-defined duties of individuals];

- \[b.\] Documents separation of duties of individuals; and

- \[c.\] Defines information system access authorizations to support separation of duties.

## Control Additional FS Cloud Specifications
{: #additional-fs-cloud-specifications}

Ensure segregation exists such that no one individual has the authority/ability to develop, compile and/or move object code from non-production environments into production environments.

## Control Supplemental Guidance
{: #supplemental-guidance}

Separation of duties addresses the potential for abuse of authorized privileges and helps to reduce the risk of malevolent activity without collusion. Separation of duties includes, for example: (i) dividing mission functions and information system support functions among different individuals and/or roles; (ii) conducting information system support functions with different individuals (e.g., system management, programming, configuration management, quality assurance and testing, and network security); and (iii) ensuring security personnel administering access control functions do not also administer audit functions.
