# AC-18 - Wireless Access
{: #ac-18}

## Control requirements
{: #control-requirements}

The organization:

AC-18 (a)
    : Establishes usage restrictions, configuration/connection requirements, and implementation guidance for wireless access; and

AC-18 (b)
    : Authorizes wireless access to the information system prior to allowing such connections.

## NIST supplemental guidance
{: #nist-supplemental-guidance}

Wireless technologies include, for example, microwave, packet radio (UHF/VHF), 802.11x, and Bluetooth. Wireless networks use authentication protocols (e.g., EAP/TLS, PEAP), which provide credential protection and mutual authentication.
