# AC-18 - Wireless Access
{: #ac-18}

## Requirements
{: #requirements}

The organization:

a. Establishes usage restrictions, configuration/connection requirements, and implementation guidance for wireless access; and

b. Authorizes wireless access to the information system prior to allowing such connections.

## NIST supplemental guidance
{: #supplemental-guidance}

Wireless technologies include, for example, microwave, packet radio (UHF/VHF), 802.11x, and Bluetooth. Wireless networks use authentication protocols (e.g., EAP/TLS, PEAP), which provide credential protection and mutual authentication.
