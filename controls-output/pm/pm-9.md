# PM-9 - Risk Management Strategy
{: #pm-9}

## Requirements
{: #requirements}

The organization:

(a) Develops a comprehensive strategy to manage risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation associated with the operation and use of information systems;

(b) Implements the risk management strategy consistently across the organization; and

(c) Reviews and updates the risk management strategy [at least annually] or as required, to address organizational changes.

## NIST supplemental guidance
{: #supplemental-guidance}

An organization-wide risk management strategy includes, for example, an unambiguous expression of the risk tolerance for the organization, acceptable risk assessment methodologies, risk mitigation strategies, a process for consistently evaluating risk across the organization with respect to the organizationâ€™s risk tolerance, and approaches for monitoring risk over time. The use of a risk executive function can facilitate consistent, organization-wide application of the risk management strategy. The organization-wide risk management strategy can be informed by risk-related inputs from other sources both internal and external to the organization to ensure the strategy is both broad-based and comprehensive.
