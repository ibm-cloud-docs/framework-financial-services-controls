# CA-7 (1) - Independent Assessment
{: #ca-7.1}

## Requirements
{: #requirements}

The organization employs assessors or assessment teams with [organization-defined level of independence] to monitor the security controls in the information system on an ongoing basis.

## Control Supplemental Guidance
{: #supplemental-guidance}

Organizations can maximize the value of assessments of security controls during the continuous monitoring process by requiring that such assessments be conducted by assessors or assessment teams with appropriate levels of independence based on continuous monitoring strategies. Assessor independence provides a degree of impartiality to the monitoring process. To achieve such impartiality, assessors should not: (i) create a mutual or conflicting interest with the organizations where the assessments are being conducted; (ii) assess their own work; (iii) act as management or employees of the organizations they are serving; or (iv) place themselves in advocacy positions for the organizations acquiring their services.
