# IA-5 (5) - Change Authenticators Prior to Delivery
{: #ia-5.5}

## Control requirements
{: #control-requirements}

IA-5 (5) - 0
    : The organization requires developers/installers of information system components to provide unique authenticators or change default authenticators prior to delivery/installation.

## NIST supplemental guidance
{: #nist-supplemental-guidance}

This control enhancement extends the requirement for organizations to change default authenticators upon information system installation, by requiring developers and/or installers to provide unique authenticators or change default authenticators for system components prior to delivery and/or installation. However, it typically does not apply to the developers of commercial off-the-shelve information technology products. Requirements for unique authenticators can be included in acquisition documents prepared by organizations when procuring information systems or system components.
