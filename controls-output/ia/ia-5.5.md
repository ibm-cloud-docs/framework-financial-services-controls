### IA-5 (5) - 0


Require developers and installers of system components to provide unique authenticators or change default authenticators prior to delivery and installation.












## NIST supplemental guidance
{: #nist-supplemental-guidance}

Changing authenticators prior to the delivery and installation of system components extends the requirement for organizations to change default authenticators upon system installation by requiring developers and/or installers to provide unique authenticators or change default authenticators for system components prior to delivery and/or installation. However, it typically does not apply to developers of commercial off-the-shelf information technology products. Requirements for unique authenticators can be included in acquisition documents prepared by organizations when procuring systems or system components.
