# IA-5 (5) - Change Authenticators Prior To Delivery
{: #ia-5.5}

## Requirements
{: #requirements}

The organization requires developers/installers of information system components to provide unique authenticators or change default authenticators prior to delivery/installation.

## Control Supplemental Guidance
{: #supplemental-guidance}

This control enhancement extends the requirement for organizations to change default authenticators upon information system installation, by requiring developers and/or installers to provide unique authenticators or change default authenticators for system components prior to delivery and/or installation. However, it typically does not apply to the developers of commercial off-the-shelve information technology products. Requirements for unique authenticators can be included in acquisition documents prepared by organizations when procuring information systems or system components.
