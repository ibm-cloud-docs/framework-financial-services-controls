Receiving authorization from _[Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]_ to assign an individual, group, role, service, or device identifier.


### IA-4 (b)

Selecting an identifier that identifies an individual, group, role, service, or device.

Assigning the identifier to the intended individual, group, role, service, or device.


### IA-4 (d)

## Additional IBM Cloud for Financial Services specifications
{: #additional-ibm-cloud-for-financial-services-specifications}

The organization must follow customer requirements when establishing customer identifiers including:
- aligning with customer email address or unique number corresponding to a user
- prohibiting the use of Social Security Numbers (SSN) or customer-specific identifiers in the organization's internal environment







## NIST supplemental guidance
{: #nist-supplemental-guidance}

Common device identifiers include Media Access Control (MAC) addresses, Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, or device-unique token identifiers. The management of individual identifiers is not applicable to shared system accounts. Typically, individual identifiers are the usernames of the system accounts assigned to those individuals. In such instances, the account management activities of AC-2 use account names provided by IA-4. Identifier management also addresses individual identifiers not necessarily associated with system accounts. Preventing the reuse of identifiers implies preventing the assignment of previously used individual, group, role, service, or device identifiers to different individuals, groups, roles, services, or devices.
