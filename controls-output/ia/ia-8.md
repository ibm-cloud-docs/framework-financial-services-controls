# IA-8 - Identification And Authentication (Non-Organizational Users)
{: #ia-8}

## Control requirements
{: #control-requirements}

The information system uniquely identifies and authenticates non-organizational users (or processes acting on behalf of non-organizational users).

## NIST supplemental guidance
{: #nist-supplemental-guidance}

Non-organizational users include information system users other than organizational users explicitly covered by IA-2. These individuals are uniquely identified and authenticated for accesses other than those accesses explicitly identified and documented in AC-14. In accordance with the E-Authentication E-Government initiative, authentication of non-organizational users accessing federal information systems may be required to protect federal, proprietary, or privacy-related information (with exceptions noted for national security systems). Organizations use risk assessments to determine authentication needs and consider scalability, practicality, and security in balancing the need to ensure ease of use for access to federal information and information systems with the need to protect and adequately mitigate risk. IA-2 addresses identification and authentication requirements for access to information systems by organizational users.
