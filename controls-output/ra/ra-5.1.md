## IBM Cloud for Financial Services profile
{: #scc-fs-cloud-profile}

The goals that follow are part of the IBM Cloud for Financial Services v0.6.0 profile in [{{site.data.keyword.compliance_full}}](/docs/security-compliance?topic=security-compliance-getting-started).

- 3000601: Check whether Container Registry Vulnerability Advisor scans for critical or high vulnerabilities in the system at least every # day(s) 
- 3000611: Check whether Container Registry Vulnerability Advisor scans images for OS vulnerability detection

## NIST supplemental guidance
{: #supplemental-guidance}

The vulnerabilities to be scanned need to be readily updated as new vulnerabilities are discovered, announced, and scanning methods developed. This updating process helps to ensure that potential vulnerabilities in the information system are identified and addressed as quickly as possible.
