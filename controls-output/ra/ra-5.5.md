# RA-5 (5) -  Privileged Access

## Control requirements

### RA-5 (5) - 0


Implement privileged access authorization to _[IBM Assignment: operating systems, databases, container images, and web applications]_ for _[IBM Assignment: vulnerability scans]_.












## NIST supplemental guidance
{: #nist-supplemental-guidance}

In certain situations, the nature of the vulnerability scanning may be more intrusive, or the system component that is the subject of the scanning may contain classified or controlled unclassified information, such as personally identifiable information. Privileged access authorization to selected system components facilitates more thorough vulnerability scanning and protects the sensitive nature of such scanning.
