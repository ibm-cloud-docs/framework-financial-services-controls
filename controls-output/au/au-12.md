# AU-12 - Audit Generation
{: #au-12}

## Control requirements
{: #control-requirements}

The information system:

AU-12 (a)
    : Provides audit record generation capability for the auditable events defined in AU-2 a. at _[all information system and network components where audit capability is deployed/available]_;

AU-12 (b)
    : Allows _[organization-defined personnel or roles]_ to select which auditable events are to be audited by specific components of the information system; and

AU-12 (c)
    : Generates audit records for the events defined in AU-2 d. with the content defined in AU-3.

## IBM Cloud for Financial Services profile
{: #scc-fs-cloud-profile}

The goals that follow are part of the IBM Cloud for Financial Services v0.6.0 profile in [{{site.data.keyword.compliance_full}}](/docs/security-compliance?topic=security-compliance-getting-started).

| Requirement ID | Goals |
|----------------|-------|
| AU-12 (a) | - 3000118: Check that there is an Activity Tracker event route defined to collect global events generated by IBM Cloud services | 
| AU-12 (b) | - 3000118: Check that there is an Activity Tracker event route defined to collect global events generated by IBM Cloud services | 
| AU-12 (c) | - 3000118: Check that there is an Activity Tracker event route defined to collect global events generated by IBM Cloud services |

## NIST supplemental guidance
{: #nist-supplemental-guidance}

Audit records can be generated from many different information system components. The list of audited events is the set of events for which audits are to be generated. These events are typically a subset of all events for which the information system is capable of generating audit records.
