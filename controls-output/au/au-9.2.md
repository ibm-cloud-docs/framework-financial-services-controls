# AU-9 (2) - Audit Backup On Separate Physical Systems / Components
{: #au-9.2}

## Requirements
{: #requirements}

The information system backs up audit records _[at least weekly]_ onto a physically different system or system component than the system or component being audited.

## NIST supplemental guidance
{: #supplemental-guidance}

This control enhancement helps to ensure that a compromise of the information system being audited does not also result in a compromise of the audit records.
