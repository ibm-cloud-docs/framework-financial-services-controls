# AU-4 - Audit Storage Capacity
{: #au-4}

## Requirements
{: #requirements}

The organization allocates audit record storage capacity in accordance with [organization-defined audit record storage requirements].

## Control Supplemental Guidance

Allocating sufficient audit storage capacity reduces the likelihood of such capacity being exceeded and resulting in the potential loss or reduction of auditing capability.
