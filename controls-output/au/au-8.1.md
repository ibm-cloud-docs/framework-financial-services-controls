# AU-8 (1) - Synchronization With Authoritative Time Source
{: #au-8.1}

## Control requirements
{: #control-requirements}

The information system:

- ((a)\] Compares the internal information system clocks _[authoritative time source: servertime.service.softlayer.com]_ with _[at least hourly]_; and
- ((b)\] Synchronizes the internal system clocks to the authoritative time source when the time difference is greater than _[organization-defined time period]_.

## NIST supplemental guidance
{: #nist-supplemental-guidance}

This control enhancement provides uniformity of time stamps for information systems with multiple system clocks and systems connected over a network.
