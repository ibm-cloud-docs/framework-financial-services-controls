# AU-8 (1) - Synchronization With Authoritative Time Source
{: #au-8.1}

## Requirements
{: #requirements}

The information system:

- \[(a)\] Compares the internal information system clocks [authoritative time source: servertime.service.softlayer.com] with [at least hourly]; and

- \[(b)\] Synchronizes the internal system clocks to the authoritative time source when the time difference is greater than [organization-defined time period].

## NIST supplemental guidance
{: #supplemental-guidance}

This control enhancement provides uniformity of time stamps for information systems with multiple system clocks and systems connected over a network.
