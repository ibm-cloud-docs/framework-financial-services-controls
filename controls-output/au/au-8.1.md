# AU-8 (1) - Synchronization with Authoritative Time Source
{: #au-8.1}

## Control requirements
{: #control-requirements}

The information system:

AU-8 (1) (a)
    : Compares the internal information system clocks _[[Assignment: organization-defined frequency]_] with _[[Assignment: organization-defined authoritative time source]_]; and

AU-8 (1) (b)
    : Synchronizes the internal system clocks to the authoritative time source when the time difference is greater than _[[Assignment: organization-defined time period]_].

## NIST supplemental guidance
{: #nist-supplemental-guidance}

This control enhancement provides uniformity of time stamps for information systems with multiple system clocks and systems connected over a network.
