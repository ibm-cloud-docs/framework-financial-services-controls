# SC-7 (5) - Deny By Default / Allow By Exception
{: #sc-7.5}

## Requirements
{: #requirements}

The information system at managed interfaces denies network communications traffic by default and allows network communications traffic by exception (i.e., deny all, permit by exception).

## Control Supplemental Guidance
{: #supplemental-guidance}

This control enhancement applies to both inbound and outbound network communications traffic. A deny-all, permit-by-exception network communications traffic policy ensures that only those connections which are essential and approved are allowed.
