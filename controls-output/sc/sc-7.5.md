### SC-7 (5) - 0


Deny network communications traffic by default and allow network communications traffic by exception _[IBM Assignment: any systems]_.












## NIST supplemental guidance
{: #nist-supplemental-guidance}

Denying by default and allowing by exception applies to inbound and outbound network communications traffic. A deny-all, permit-by-exception network communications traffic policy ensures that only those system connections that are essential and approved are allowed. Deny by default, allow by exception also applies to a system that is connected to an external system.
