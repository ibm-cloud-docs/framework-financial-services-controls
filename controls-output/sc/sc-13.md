# SC-13 - Cryptographic Protection
{: #sc-13}

## Control requirements
{: #control-requirements}



### SC-13 (a)


Determine the _[IBM Assignment: the requirements in Supplemental Guidance for Cryptography Governance]_.


### SC-13 (b)


Implement the following types of cryptography required for each specified cryptographic use: _[IBM Assignment: the requirements in Supplemental Guidance for Cryptography Governance]_.






## Additional IBM Cloud for Financial Services specifications
{: #additional-ibm-cloud-for-financial-services-specifications}

The organization must develop an overall cryptographic governance program that meets customer requirements and includes:
- Security requirements for cryptographic hardware and software modules 
- Cryptographic key establishment and management requirements
- Cryptographic key management technology and processes used to produce, control, and distribute symmetric and asymmetric cryptographic keys
- Hash algorithms used
- Random, pseudo-random, and prime number generator algorithms used
- Cryptographic key sizes, operational lifecycles, storage, and distribution methods
- Reliance on cryptographic services including certificate authorities (CA)




## Implementation guidance

## NIST supplemental guidance
{: #nist-supplemental-guidance}

Cryptography can be employed to support a variety of security solutions, including the protection of classified information and controlled unclassified information, the provision and implementation of digital signatures, and the enforcement of information separation when authorized individuals have the necessary clearances but lack the necessary formal access approvals. Cryptography can also be used to support random number and hash generation. Generally applicable cryptographic standards include FIPS-validated cryptography and NSA-approved cryptography. For example, organizations that need to protect classified information may specify the use of NSA-approved cryptography. Organizations that need to provision and implement digital signatures may specify the use of FIPS-validated cryptography. Cryptography is implemented in accordance with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines.
