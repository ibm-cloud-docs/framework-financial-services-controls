# SC-5 - Denial Of Service Protection
{: #sc-5}

## Requirements
{: #requirements}

The information system protects against or limits the effects of the following types of denial of service attacks: [application and volumetric based attacks (OSI layers 3, 4, 6, and 7)] by employing [annual testing of the documented DoS and DDoS mitigation technologies].

## Control Supplemental Guidance
{: #supplemental-guidance}

A variety of technologies exist to limit, or in some cases, eliminate the effects of denial of service attacks. For example, boundary protection devices can filter certain types of packets to protect information system components on internal organizational networks from being directly affected by denial of service attacks. Employing increased capacity and bandwidth combined with service redundancy may also reduce the susceptibility to denial of service attacks.

| Parameter ID | Values | Label or Choices |
|---|---|---|
| sc-5_prm_1 | application and volumetric based attacks (OSI layers 3, 4, 6, and 7) | organization-defined types of denial of service attacks or references to sources for such information |
| sc-5_prm_2 | annual testing of the documented DoS and DDoS mitigation technologies | organization-defined security safeguards |
