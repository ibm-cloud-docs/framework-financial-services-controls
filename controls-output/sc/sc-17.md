# SC-17 - Public Key Infrastructure Certificates
{: #sc-17}

## Control requirements
{: #control-requirements}



### SC-17 (a)


Issue public key certificates under an _[IBM Assignment: organization-defined certificate policy in accordance with the Supplemental Guidance for Cryptography Governance]_ or obtain public key certificates from an approved service provider.


### SC-17 (b)


Include only approved trust anchors in trust stores or certificate stores managed by the organization.






## Additional IBM Cloud for Financial Services specifications
{: #additional-ibm-cloud-for-financial-services-specifications}

The organization must implement certificate management processes including:
- Obtaining certificates from a customer-approved service provider / certificate authority
- Issued certificates must identify allowed key operations
- Certificates must only be used in accordance with key attributes as specified within the certificate
- A new key pair must be created, and another certificate obtained when a certificate is becomes invalid 







## NIST supplemental guidance
{: #nist-supplemental-guidance}

Public key infrastructure certificates are certificates with visibility external to organizational systems and certificates related to the internal operations of systems, such as application-specific time services. In cryptographic systems with a hierarchical structure, a trust anchor is an authoritative source (i.e., a certificate authority) for which trust is assumed and not derived. A root certificate for a PKI system is an example of a trust anchor. A trust store or certificate store maintains a list of trusted root certificates.
