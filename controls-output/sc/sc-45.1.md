# SC-45 (1) -  Synchronization with Authoritative Time Source
{: #sc-45.1}

## Control requirements
{: #control-requirements}



### SC-45 (1) (a)


Compare the internal system clocks _[IBM Assignment: at least hourly]_ with _[IBM Assignment: authoritative time source: servertime.service.softlayer.com]_.


### SC-45 (1) (b)


Synchronize the internal system clocks to the authoritative time source when the time difference is greater than _[Assignment: organization-defined time period]_.












## NIST supplemental guidance
{: #nist-supplemental-guidance}

Synchronization of internal system clocks with an authoritative source provides uniformity of time stamps for systems with multiple system clocks and systems connected over a network.
