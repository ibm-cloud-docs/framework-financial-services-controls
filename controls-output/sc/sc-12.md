## Implementation guidance
{: #implementation-guidance}

See the resources that follow to learn more about how to implement this control.

- [Data encryption in transit](/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-shared-encryption-in-transit)
- [Data encryption at rest](/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-shared-encryption-at-rest)

## IBM Cloud for Financial Services profile
{: #scc-fs-cloud-profile}

The goals that follow are part of the IBM Cloud for Financial Services v0.5.0 profile in [{{site.data.keyword.compliance_full}}](/docs/security-compliance?topic=security-compliance-getting-started).

- 3000234: Check whether Hyper Protect Crypto Services instance is enabled with a dual authorization deletion policy 
- 3000235: Check whether Hyper Protect Crypto Services encryption keys that are generated by the service are rotated automatically at least every # months

## NIST supplemental guidance
{: #supplemental-guidance}

Cryptographic key management and establishment can be performed using manual procedures or automated mechanisms with supporting manual procedures. Organizations define key management requirements in accordance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidance, specifying appropriate options, levels, and parameters. Organizations manage trust stores to ensure that only approved trust anchors are in such trust stores. This includes certificates with visibility external to organizational information systems and certificates related to the internal operations of systems.
