# SC-10 - Network Disconnect
{: #sc-10}

## Requirements
{: #requirements}

The information system terminates the network connection associated with a communications session at the end of the session or after [no longer than 30 minutes for RAS-based sessions or no longer than 60 minutes for non-interactive user sessions] of inactivity.

## IBM Cloud for Financial Services profile
{: #scc-fs-cloud-profile}

The goals that follow are part of the IBM Cloud for Financial Services v0.5.0 profile in [{{site.data.keyword.compliance_full}}](/docs/security-compliance?topic=security-compliance-getting-started).

- 3000050: Check that sign out for active sessions is set to # hours or less for IBM Cloud accounts 
- 3000724: Check whether App ID access tokens are configured to expire within # minutes

## NIST supplemental guidance
{: #supplemental-guidance}

This control applies to both internal and external networks. Terminating network connections associated with communications sessions include, for example, de-allocating associated TCP/IP address/port pairs at the operating system level, or de-allocating networking assignments at the application level if multiple application sessions are using a single, operating system-level network connection. Time periods of inactivity may be established by organizations and include, for example, time periods by type of network access or for specific network accesses.
