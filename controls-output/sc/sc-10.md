# SC-10 - Network Disconnect
{: #sc-10}

## Requirements
{: #requirements}

The information system terminates the network connection associated with a communications session at the end of the session or after [no longer than 30 minutes for RAS-based sessions or no longer than 60 minutes for non-interactive user sessions] of inactivity.

## Control Supplemental Guidance
{: #supplemental-guidance}

This control applies to both internal and external networks. Terminating network connections associated with communications sessions include, for example, de-allocating associated TCP/IP address/port pairs at the operating system level, or de-allocating networking assignments at the application level if multiple application sessions are using a single, operating system-level network connection. Time periods of inactivity may be established by organizations and include, for example, time periods by type of network access or for specific network accesses.

| Parameter ID | Values | Label or Choices |
|---|---|---|
| sc-10_prm_1 | no longer than 30 minutes for RAS-based sessions or no longer than 60 minutes for non-interactive user sessions | organization-defined time period |
