# CP-4 - Contingency Plan Testing
{: #cp-4}

## Requirements
{: #requirements}

The organization:

(a) Tests the contingency plan for the information system [at least annually] using [functional exercises] to determine the effectiveness of the plan and the organizational readiness to execute the plan;

(b) Reviews the contingency plan test results; and

(c) Initiates corrective actions, if needed.

## NIST supplemental guidance
{: #supplemental-guidance}

Methods for testing contingency plans to determine the effectiveness of the plans and to identify potential weaknesses in the plans include, for example, walk-through and tabletop exercises, checklists, simulations (parallel, full interrupt), and comprehensive exercises. Organizations conduct testing based on the continuity requirements in contingency plans and include a determination of the effects on organizational operations, assets, and individuals arising due to contingency operations. Organizations have flexibility and discretion in the breadth, depth, and timelines of corrective actions.
