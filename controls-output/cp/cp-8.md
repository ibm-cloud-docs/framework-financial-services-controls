## Control requirements

### CP-8 - 0


Establish alternate telecommunications services, including necessary agreements to permit the resumption of _[Assignment: organization-defined system operations]_ for essential mission and business functions within _[Assignment: organization-defined time period]_ when the primary telecommunications capabilities are unavailable at either the primary or alternate processing or storage sites.












## NIST supplemental guidance
{: #nist-supplemental-guidance}

Telecommunications services (for data and voice) for primary and alternate processing and storage sites are in scope for CP-8. Alternate telecommunications services reflect the continuity requirements in contingency plans to maintain essential mission and business functions despite the loss of primary telecommunications services. Organizations may specify different time periods for primary or alternate sites. Alternate telecommunications services include additional organizational or commercial ground-based circuits or lines, network-based approaches to telecommunications, or the use of satellites. Organizations consider factors such as availability, quality of service, and access when entering into alternate telecommunications agreements.
