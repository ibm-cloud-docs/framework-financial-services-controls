# ESA-6 - Source Code Management
{: #esa-6}

## Control requirements
{: #control-requirements}

Maintain version control of code repositories related to applications and/or services provided to FSS Cloud customers. The organization limits ‘read-only’ and ‘read-write’ access to only authorized users who have a valid job function/role to access the source code. The organization must be able to reconstruct the operational equivalent of the binaries and configuration running in production. The organization ensures third and fourth parties meet the same source code management requirements stated above.
