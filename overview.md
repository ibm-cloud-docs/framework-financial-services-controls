# IBM Cloud Framework for Financial Services - Control Requirements (DEMO)
{: #overview}

[{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} for Financial Servicesâ„¢](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/financial-services){: external} is designed to build trust and enable a transparent public cloud ecosystem with the features for security, compliance, and resiliency that financial institutions require. Financial institutions can confidently host their mission-critical applications in the cloud and transact quickly and efficiently. With a large partner ecosystem of independent software vendors (ISVs), Software as a Service (SaaS), and fintech partners, {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} for Financial Services offers a new generation of cloud for the enterprise. Financial institutions can now deploy on public cloud to enable innovation and deliver new outstanding customer experiences, while managing stringent industry regulations for sensitive data and complex workloads.

The {{site.data.keyword.framework-fs_full}} provides a comprehensive set of control requirements designed to help address the security requirements and regulatory compliance obligations of financial institutions and cloud best practices. The cloud best practices include a shared responsibility model across financial institutions, application providers, and {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.

The technology-agnostic control requirements defined in the framework were built by the industry for the industry. The framework contains 565 control requirements that span 7 focus areas and 21 control families. The control requirements were initially based on [NIST 800-53 Rev 4](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/risk-management/sp800-53-controls/release-search#!/800-53?version=4.0){: external} and have been enhanced based on feedback from leading industry partners.


See [{{site.data.keyword.framework-fs_notm}} - Control Requirements](https://cloud.ibm.com/media/docs/downloads/framework-financial-services/IBM_Cloud_Framework_for_Financial_Services_-_Control_Requirements_v1.1.0.xlsx){: external} for a spreadsheet of the control requirements.

See [Getting started with {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} for Financial Services](/docs/framework-financial-services) for reference architectures and prescriptive implementation guidance to learn more about how best to meet the control requirements.
